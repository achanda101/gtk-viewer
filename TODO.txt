 - Fix accelerators handled manually with key bindings (Left, Right, Esc, V)
 - Don't rely on external programs; reimplement using libraries (pdf, video, gif manipulation)
 - Support for delete / undelete in Mac OS X
 - Application name and icon

Features:
 - Integrate metadata manipulation for MP3s/PDFs/EPubs (show, edit, autogen)
